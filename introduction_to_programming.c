public class InttroductionToProgramming {
    A computer ->its a device which xconsisit of multiple devices sepcially storage devuices like RAM,ROM
    Process devices->its used for doing processing of the data like CPU which is used to add substract things written in a file.
    Ouput devices -> which is used to display the output on the screen eg like LED.

        why computer pgrm exists
            because if no computer pgrm exist then who will tell compuyter how to execute the task.

    The code or the program that you write is a software.

        //we can short an array of smaller size manually
    //but it will take a lot opf time for solving for millions of size
    //thats why we need computer pgrm as they are faster
    //computer pgrm are structured and have a termination condition
    //while solving problm manually doesnt have structured and termination condition.
    //as computer can understand only 0's and 1's we have programming language like C++,java for communicating with computer.
    //Compiler is used to C++,java into low level binary code.
    //why our local language isnt applicable because its ambigous in nature.
//for computer pgrm to read an input generally its done through stdin .and give outpout through stdout
    //there ares some other ways as well
    //file ,network through which it takes input
    //and write output into another file and network.

//
//    firstly we compile our code which then produces executable format and then we run it.
//    IDE providez a platoform where we can write our java /C++ code and can run and compile our code througb compile and run button.
