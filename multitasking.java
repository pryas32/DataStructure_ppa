    //multitasking-> its a process of doing more thqan one task at a same time eg
    //working on doc and doing browsing

//mulithreading->it is running more than one task within the process
//eg when writing in ide it helps in formatting the code as well as debugging the code
//eg browser -> what happens that on one end we listen music and on browsing they are within sae process

//advanctages of multithreading 

//parallelism and imroved performance
//ie we can do more than one tasl within the process.
//disadvantages
//deadlock   1.race condition

// we can achieve multithreading through two ways
//extending the thread class
//implementing the runnable interface.
